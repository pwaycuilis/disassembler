# disassembler
Disassembler (and Simulator) coded in python for Computer Architecture class

Compile and run team23_project2.py (driver file)

Runs disassembler.py, loads and executes binary ARM input file branchtest_bin.txt disassembles code and takes output and runs simulator.py.
    Outputs content onto two text files (1) team23_out_dis.txt and (2) team23_out_sim.txt
    
(1) will contain the disassembled program code 

(2) instruction by instruction simulation of ARM program. Executes instructions sequentially (non-pipelined) and output the contents of all registers and memory after each instruction.
